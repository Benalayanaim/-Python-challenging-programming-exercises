# -Question 1 :
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a 
single line.

# Question 2 :

Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be:40320

# Question 3 :
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i x i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.

# Question 4
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program

# Question 5
Define a class which has at least two methods:

getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

# Question 6
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:

Q = Square root of [(2 _ C _ D)/H]

Following are the fixed values of C and H:

C is 50. H is 30.

D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.For example Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program

# Question 7 
_Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.*

Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5

# Question 8
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

# Question 9
Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.

# Question 10
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.

# Question 11
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

# Question 12
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# Question 13
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.

# Question 14
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

# Question 15
Write a program that computes the value of a+aa+aaa+aaaa with a given digit as the value of a.

# Question 16
Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.

# Question 17
Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input.

# Question 18
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

Following are the criteria for checking the password:

At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

# Question 19
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, score) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and score are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:

1: Sort based on name
2: Then sort based on age
3: Then sort by score
The priority is that name > age > score.
