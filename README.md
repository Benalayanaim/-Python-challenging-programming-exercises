getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.

# Question 6
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:

Q = Square root of [(2 _ C _ D)/H]

Following are the fixed values of C and H:

C is 50. H is 30.

D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.For example Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program

# Question 7 
_Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i _ j.*

Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5

# Question 8
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

# Question 9
Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.

# Question 10
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.

# Question 11
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.

# Question 12
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

# Question 13
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.

# Question 14
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

# Question 15
Write a program that computes the value of a+aa+aaa+aaaa with a given digit as the value of a.

# Question 16
Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers.

# Question 17
Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input.

# Question 18
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

Following are the criteria for checking the password:

At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

# Question 19
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, score) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and score are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:

1: Sort based on name
2: Then sort based on age
3: Then sort by score
The priority is that name > age > score.

# Question 20
Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

# Question 21
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps.

# Question 22
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.

# Question 23
Write a method which can calculate square value of number

# Question 24
Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.

Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()

And add document for your own function

# Question 25
Define a class, which have a class parameter and have a same instance parameter.

# Question 26
Define a function which can compute the sum of two numbers.

# Question 27
Define a function that can convert a integer into a string and print it in console.

# Question 29
Define a function that can accept two strings as input and concatenate them and then print it in console.


# Question 30
Define a function that can accept two strings as input and print the string with maximum length in console. If two strings have the same length, then the function should print all strings line by line.
# Question 31
Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys.

# Question 32
Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the keys only.

# Question 33
Define a function which can generate and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).

# Question 34
